# Cesium (for Fabric)

Cesium is a free and open-source fork of sodium, which allows you to change minecraft physics, and optimize minecraft as well as sodium.

:warning: Cesium in alpha is just like sodium, and it has a lot of bugs! 

### Downloads

You can build from sources (./gradlew build or gradle build), or download a release.


#### Prerequisites

You will need to install JDK 8 (or newer, see below) in order to build Cesium/Sodium. You can either install this through
a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other
platforms. If you'd prefer to not use a package manager, you can always grab the installers or packages directly from
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

On Windows, the Oracle JDK/JRE builds should be avoided where possible due to their poor quality. Always prefer using
the open-source builds from AdoptOpenJDK when possible.

### License

Cesium is licensed under GNU LGPLv3 (sodium too), a free and open-source license.
